Patricks Blog is a CMS I created with the PHP Codeigniter framework. I used MVC design pattern to construct the application. Its a database driven site that allows me to add pages, users, and subjects. And since every web developer needs a CMS I decided to go the old-fashioned route and do a tutorial that showed me the ends and outs of Codeigniter and then add other features as I saw fit.
